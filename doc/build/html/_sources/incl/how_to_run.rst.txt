How to run stack overflow analysis
==================================

Get the repository
------------------

As a first step clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bat

   cd <put-your-target-folder-here>
   git clone https://github.com/HBernigau/StackOverflowAnalysis.git
   
After executing this command the folder *StackOverflowAnalysis* will be downloaded into the target folder.
Change into that folder by typing

.. code-block:: bat

   cd StackOverflowAnalysis

.. warning::

   All subsequent steps assume that you are within the **package root**, i.e. the folder *<your_target_folder>/StackOverflowAnalysis*.


Build the virtual environment
-----------------------------

The application has been tested using *Python 3.8.6* on a
Windows computer with *Windows 10 Enterprise*.

If you want to use the same Python version, we recommend
using `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ as well. *pyenv* allows the
management of multiple Python versions on the same machine. You can install a new python version (here: 3.8.6) by using the command

.. code-block:: bat

   pyenv install 3.8.6

If you are in the application's root folder, if you are using *pyenv* and if you installed Python 3.8.6, then the python version is automtically
switched to 3.8.6 (this is what the file *.python-version* is good for). You can check this by typing

.. code-block:: bat

   pyenv version

In order to build a new virtual environment in subfolder *venv* type:

.. code-block:: bat

   python -m venv venv
   
Activate that environment by typing

.. code-block:: bat

   activate_venv.bat
   
.. warning::
   
   For the following commands we assume that the virtual environment has been activated.

For dependency management the current application uses `pip-tools <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`_ ,
which can be considered as a best-practice for dependency management in Python. Install it into your virtual environment using pip:

.. code-block:: bat

   python -m pip install pip-tools


.. note::

   If you encounter a permission error like the following:

   .. image:: img/Screenshot_permission_error.png

   Please switch to the user's *AppData/Local/Temp* folder in Windows explorer, right click on that folder and choose the menu item *"Properties"*
   from the context menu. In panel *General* uncheck the attribute *read-only* and in panel *Security* check the permissions and
   readjust if appropriate. Then re-run the previous command.

.. note::

   When writing this guide, there exists an open issue regarding compatibility of pip and
   pip-tools (see `issue 1558 for pip-tools on Github <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1558>`_ ), 
   which can be fixed temporarily by the following work-around: Use a pip version below 22.0 .
   
   The command for installing a specific pip version (21 here) is:

   .. code-block:: bat
   
      pip install pip==21


Now within your activated virtual environment, you can sync the project's requirements file with the virtual environment by typing:

.. code-block:: bat

   build_full.bat


If you want to re-generate the requirements file
from first order dependencies (i.e. you prefer using the latest available versions of all libraries), then
- before calling the build script, *build_full.bat* - enter the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   compile_full.bat

You can also use the frozen library versions first and update the libraries at any later point in time.

Start Docker containers
-----------------------

The application uses a `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database and an
`elastic search <https://www.elastic.co/de/elasticsearch/>`_
database as backends which are run in Docker containers.

Hence, the application requires installation of
`Docker Desktop <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>`_ .

In order to run the application some environment variables
must be set. This can best be done by copying the *.env*
file from *templates* folder into the root folder and set the
variable *PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL* to some email address that
is then used as login information for
`PGAdmin <https://www.pgadmin.org/>`_ , a management tool for
PostgreSQL databases.

.. warning::
   
   For the following steps we assume that a valid *.env* file is located in the package root.

.. note::

   You can also change other environment variables,
   like the password for PostgreSQL or various ports.
   The latter might be necessary, if you should encounter
   any port conflicts for example.

If you want to change the database connection information in the *.env* file,
please read the following note:

.. note::

   If you alter PostgreSQL connection data, please note the following:

   One of the Docker containers connects to the
   PostgreSQL database and builds the latest version
   of the application's database using `alembic <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/>`_ .
   In order to make that work, please also adjust the database
   urls in *./alembic/alembic.ini*, line 38 and in
   *./alembic/alembic_docker.ini*, line 38 (as the names suggest,
   *alembic_docker.ini* is the connection data from within Docker).

   Secondly the pgAdmin container requires valid connection
   data as well. Therefore, please adjust the settings in
   *Docker/directories/pgadmin_config_data/servers.json*

   Last but not least the application itself requires valid
   connection strings as well, which can be adjusted in
   *./data/config/so_ana_config.yaml* under db_opts -> postgres.

   If you changed elastic search connection data,
   please adjust the application's connection data in
   *./data/config/so_ana_config.yaml* under db_opts -> elastic_search.

in order to start all Docker containers type the following in
cmd:

.. code-block:: bat

   launch_docker_containers.bat

Start Prefect
-------------

The application uses `Prefect <https://www.prefect.io/>`_
for workflow management, and the individual tasks are
run in a `dask-cluster <https://dask.org/>`_ .

In order to run the cluster do the following:

1. Start dask:

.. code-block:: bat

   launch_dask.bat

2. Start the prefect server:

.. code-block:: bat

   launch_prefect_server.bat

3. Start the prefect client:

.. code-block:: bat

   launch_prefect_client.bat

Now you can use the command line application, *so_ana.py*,
to interact with the server. In order to see all
available commands, call:

.. code-block:: bat

   python so_ana.py --help

.. note::

   When configured as described above, prefect does not persist run-time information,
   i.e. prefect server loses any information about previous runs.

   Even though prefect in principle allows providing a storage location for
   its PostgreSQL backend, this is not very helpful under Windows, as
   assigning Windows hard drives conflicts with Linux user-permission in Windows.

   As a work-around you can use Docker managed drives. In order to do that,
   the file *./venv/Lib/site-packages/cli/docker-compose.yml* has to be
   modified. In order to see an example, please open the file
   *./templates/.docker-compose_prefect.yml*.
   The essential modifications are in:

   - Line 18: mapping the docker-managed drive "prefect_postgresdata_so_analysis" to */var/lib/postgresql/data*
   - Line 19: mapping the back-up folder to */pg_backup/*. Note that this is relevant
     if you want to back-up the prefect database. Otherwise you can skip these lines
   - Line 147-148: defining the docker-managed drive *prefect_postgresdata_so_analysis*

Run your first sample workflow
------------------------------

Generally, flow configurations are stored in *./data/config*.
The most straight-forward way to run the sample configuration
*adm_smpl.yaml*, is using the command line utility, *so_ana.py*:

.. code-block:: bat

   activate_venv.bat
   python so_ana.py run --test adm_smpl.yaml python so_ana.py run --test adm_smpl.yaml Holger.Bernigau@gmx.de "Software Engineering Research@University of St.Gallen"

This command executes the flow with configuration *adm_smpl.yaml* in test modus.
For all requests to stack-overflow, the user provides some credentials within
the request headers (from_email="Holger.Bernigau@gmx.de" / user_agent="Software Engineering Research@University of St.Gallen").
This is in line with `ethical best-practices for web-scrapping <https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01>`_ .

A more convenient way to execute the flow, is submitting it to prefect server.
This can be done by calling the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   python so_ana.py register

before running the script, you should clear all previous data
(as the step names to be provided in the sample configuration are supposed to be unique).

.. code-block:: bat

   python so_ana.py clear-db-data --test

Then enter "localhost:8080" in your favorite Browser to open prefect server's UI.
Change into Flows and select "so-analysis"

.. image:: img/cover_prefect_UI.png

Select the "Run" button and enter the flow parameters:

.. image:: img/run_prefect_UI_001.png

In order to enable a test-run, open the *advanced run configurations*

.. image:: img/run_prefect_UI_002.png

and enter modus test:

.. image:: img/run_prefect_UI_003.png

After clicking the *run button*, a dashboard appears
showing the run-time information of the flow.
